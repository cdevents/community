## CDEvents Translator

### Overview:
This proposal describes translating events from various source control systems into CDEvents, by using a common cdevents-translator.

A library will be developed to receive various event types and convert them into CDEvents.

Various types of source code version control systems endpoints/webhooks can be configured and implemented with in the cdevents-translator.

Instructions for configuring Gerrit webhooks and implementation details can be found in [gerrit-cdevent](gerrit-cdevents.md)
